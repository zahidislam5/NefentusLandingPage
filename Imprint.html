                    <p>Dear lawyers, <br>
                      the website “nefentus.com” does not intend to violate the rights of third parties, not even
                      negligent. However, should
                      there be problems of any kind, we would like to ask you to contact us immediately. If you suspect
                      that this website
                      violates any of your intellectual property rights, please notify us immediately by email so that
                      remedial action can be
                      taken quickly. Please note: The more time-consuming intervention of a lawyer for the fee-based
                      warning for the service
                      provider does not correspond to his real or presumed will. Establishing contact makes sense on
                      both sides to avoid
                      unnecessary litigation and unnecessary costs. We will immediately have your objection examined and
                      immediately stop it
                      if warranted. Without prior contact, we will reject the cost note of your legal efforts and
                      warning in the sense of a
                      duty of mitigation on your part as unfounded.
                    </p>
